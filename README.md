# Generates mesh data from Shapefiles

This is specifically designed to take data in the form found in Ordnance Survey's "Terrain 50", with contour lines and spot-heights. The format it expects is a zip file containing files with names ending `line.shp`, `line.dbf`, `point.shp`, `point.dbf`. The `dbf` files are expected to define a `PROP_VALUE` field with height information for corresponding `shp` features. I don't expect it to work with (m)any other datasets than the specific one it is written against.

It has been written in order to learn a bit of the Rust language, and see how it performs relative to an existing JavaScript implementation from a larger project. As of this writing, it seems to be significantly faster and also possibly less reliable (perhaps another part of the system is responsible for this).

A function `fetch_shp(url: string)` is exposed to JavaScript, which will attempt to fetch a zip file from the specified URL and asynchronously return an object with properties `coordinates: Float32Array` and `triangles: Uint32Array` (or an error). This may be extended to include normals, such that they don't need to be computed in JS. Intended for use within a WebWorker but can also work in window context.
